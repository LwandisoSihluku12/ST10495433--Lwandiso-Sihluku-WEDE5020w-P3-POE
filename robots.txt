# ROBOTS.TXT - Search Engine Crawler Instructions
# ========================================
#
# This file tells search engine crawlers (like Google's bot) which pages
# they can and cannot access on your website.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# - User-agent: Specifies which crawler these rules apply to (* means all)
# - Allow: Pages that crawlers CAN access
# - Disallow: Pages that crawlers CANNOT access
# - Sitemap: Location of the sitemap file
#
# WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:
# - Helps search engines index your site efficiently
# - Protects private or admin pages from being indexed
# - Improves SEO by directing crawlers to important content
# ========================================

# Allow all search engines to crawl the entire site
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Disallow crawling of any admin or private directories (if they exist)
# Disallow: /admin/
# Disallow: /private/

# Disallow crawling of scripts and stylesheets (optional - usually allowed)
# Allow: /styles.css
# Allow: /script.js

# Sitemap location
# This helps search engines find all pages on your site
Sitemap: https://www.zeussneakers.com/sitemap.xml

# ========================================
# ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
# ========================================
# 
# 1. This file must be placed in the root directory of your website
# 2. The file name must be exactly "robots.txt" (lowercase)
# 3. Search engines will look for this file at: https://yoursite.com/robots.txt
# 4. Not all crawlers respect robots.txt (malicious bots may ignore it)
# 5. Don't use robots.txt to hide sensitive information - use proper authentication instead
